## vision
Index is a collaborative project-brainstorming app. It emphasizes simplicity and usability, from the data structure through to the user interface, to create a reliable, flexible tool. Index allows students to suggest and contribute to project pitches together and then pairs students up into teams to work on those projects based on student preferences.
